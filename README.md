# MVNFOEditor [Beta]
# NOTE
This project has been sitting around "completed" for quite some time and i've been chipping away at bugs when I've had a chance - it's close enough now for it to be publically available but it has some bugs and quirks. The key functionality is solid, though, and I've found it super useful in bolstering my MTV Channel on my local [ErsatzTV](https://github.com/ErsatzTV/ErsatzTV) instance. Just keep in mind the UI navigation isn't perfect but I am working on it!
